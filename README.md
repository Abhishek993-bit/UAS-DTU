# UAS-DTU

Task Statement
You are required to write a program such that a UAV traversing towards a specific target drop location estimates its current position and decides whether to drop payload or not for successful payload delivery at target point.

How to use?
You can change the latitude, longitude and velocity values in the start.txt and end.txt files as per your requirements. Just make sure not to change format of those files, maintain the proper spaces and indents. Otherwise the code may not work.
Then you can just run the code in your terminal or even use the .exe file to execute it and then follow on screen instructions.
